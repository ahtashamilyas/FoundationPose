# predict_score.py Documentation

## Overview
The `predict_score.py` module is designed to evaluate and predict scores based on input data using a specified algorithm. This module is an essential part of the Foundation Pose project, contributing to the overall functionality of score prediction.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this module is to provide an interface for scoring predictions, enabling users to input various parameters and receive corresponding scores based on the underlying model.

## Functionality
The module includes functions that handle:
- Data preprocessing
- Score calculation based on input parameters
- Output formatting for user-friendly results

## Input Parameters
The `predict_score` function accepts the following parameters:
- `data`: A structured input containing features required for score prediction.
- `model`: The predictive model used to compute scores.
- `threshold`: An optional parameter to set the minimum score for certain evaluations.

## Output Results
The output of the module is a score or a set of scores that represent the predicted values based on the provided input. The results can be formatted as:
- A single score
- A list of scores
- A detailed report including additional metrics, if applicable.

## Example Usage
```python
from predict_score import predict_score

data = {...}  # Input data
model = ...   # Loaded model
threshold = 0.5

score = predict_score(data, model, threshold)
print(f"Predicted Score: {score}")
```

## Notes
- Ensure that the input data is preprocessed correctly to match the model's requirements.
- The module may require specific libraries, such as NumPy and Pandas, for optimal functionality.
